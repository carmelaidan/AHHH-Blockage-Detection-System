Conceptual Framework
The research is built upon a conceptual framework primarily rooted in the
Modified Manning’s Equation. The equation serves as the fundamental basis for
understanding hydraulic principles and informing system design. This equation
guides the selection of sensors, hardware configuration, data requirements, and
testing procedures. Systems Theory provides a strong foundation for organizing
and integrating the various subsystems involved in blockage detection. This theory
facilitates the design and assessment of two key prototype systems: the
experimental AHHH Blockage Detection System and the Standardized Hardware
Benchmark System (SHBS), adapted from Rajput et al. (2025), which serves as a
comparative benchmark.
To enhance system capabilities, the framework integrates Internet of Things
(IoT) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies. IoT enables
continuous, remote monitoring and data collection, while GIS provides spatial
visualization and mapping of blockage occurrences. The AHHH system leverages
both IoT and GIS, while the SHBS primarily relies on IoT with SMS alerts. The
performance of both systems is rigorously evaluated under controlled laboratory
conditions, simulating real-world scenarios. Key performance metrics include recall
score, precision, data rate, electrical power consumption, and alert response time.
Statistical analysis, using descriptive statistics and paired t-tests, will be employed
to determine significant performance differences between the systems.

By anchoring the system design in the well-established Modified Manning's
Equation, the researchers ensure a sound understanding of drainage flow
dynamics. The application of Systems Theory enables a holistic approach to
integrating and optimizing the various components of the blockage detection
system. Furthermore, the incorporation of IoT and GIS technologies provides real-
time monitoring, spatial visualization, and enhanced decision-making capabilities.

Scope, Delimitations, and Limitations
This study develops and assesses an IoT and GIS-based early warning
system for storm drain blockages, addressing the current lack of effective, real-

time monitoring that contributes to increased urban flooding. To combat this issue,
the study will define the IoT sensors, GIS technology, system designs, and
performance metrics required for blockage detection, and develop and
comparatively evaluate two system designs against conventional methods. By
providing a more effective means of early detection and response, this research
aims to enhance urban resilience and mitigate flood risks.
This study evaluates a blockage detection prototype's performance,
focusing on key indicators: recall score, precision, data rate, electrical power
consumption, and alert response time, assessed via individual t-tests. Detection
efficacy, measured as recall and precision scores, assesses the system's ability to
correctly identify blockages while minimizing both false negatives (recall) and false
positives (precision). Beyond accuracy, electrical power consumption indicates the
system's energy efficiency and reflects its operational sustainability. Data
communication is assessed by the data rate (bits/s), which measures the speed at
which sensor readings are sent to the central unit. Finally, alert response time
(seconds) indicates how quickly blockages trigger notifications, gauging
responsiveness. Statistical significance is evaluated using individual t-tests to
ensure the reliability of the results.
To validate the practical application of the prototype, a true experimental
design will be employed, comparing a fully functional hardware prototype
developed from Rajput's software-based model with the AHHH Blockage Detection
System. The system continuously monitors water levels in storm drains using
19

========== PAGE 21 ==========
ultrasonic sensors. These sensors transmit data wirelessly to a central processing
unit, where the data is analyzed to detect deviations from normal water levels.
Environmental variables, including rainfall, soil composition, and ambient water
levels, are also not included in the experimental design due to challenges in
replicating these conditions in a laboratory setting. Testing is confined to simulated
catch basins and storm drains within controlled laboratory settings, owing to health
and safety considerations and limited accessibility to real-world drainage systems.
Other theoretical models and existing prototypes are not reviewed, since the main
goal is to assess the performance of two system designs. The systems detect
obstructions and monitor water levels, but do not identify the specific nature or
cause of blockages, as this would require advanced, costly tools. The study's
communication is limited to GSM, the most cost-effective option in Metro Manila.
This constraint allows focused evaluation of transmission speed and alert
response. These delimitations ensure a targeted evaluation of the prototype's core
performance.
This study's findings are limited by several factors that affect their real-world
applicability. The Arduino-based prototype and controlled environment testing may
not accurately reflect performance in actual storm drains, where unpredictable
debris and weather conditions can affect sensor readings and reliability.
Furthermore, the accuracy of ultrasonic sensors is susceptible to environmental
factors, such as temperature, humidity, and debris accumulation, which can lead
to inaccurate data. In addition to sensor-related limitations, communication
20

========== PAGE 22 ==========
constraints exist; GSM communication can introduce potential delays due to weak
signals or network congestion, and GPS accuracy is inherently limited by urban
interference. The limitations of the Arduino platform, including its processing power
and memory capacity, limit advanced data-handling capabilities. Long-term
durability remains uncertain, and limited funding and timeframe further restricted
the study's scope.
Significance of the Study
Urban drainage issues are increasing in the Philippines, especially in Metro
Manila, making innovative drainage management essential. This study addresses
the need for proactive drainage blockage detection by using real-time ultrasonic,
IoT, and GIS technologies, offering a cost-effective, scalable solution for early
warning and enhanced monitoring of drainage systems.
This study holds a significant theoretical and methodological value. From a
theoretical perspective, this study examines the understanding of urban flooding
and drainage management. It illustrates how ultrasonic water-level measurements
can serve as indirect indicators of blockages. Moreover, it detects the actual
presence of blockages for validation, incorporating IoT and GIS technologies for
real-time monitoring and spatial data analysis. Through a performance evaluation,
this research supports technology-driven approaches to disaster risk reduction.
Unlike traditional methods, it relies on periodic manual inspections or less frequent
data collection. This research builds upon and refines existing theories of urban
21

========== PAGE 23 ==========
hydrology and disaster risk reduction. It does so by introducing real-time data
analytics to significantly improve predictive accuracy, enhancing models such as
the Rational Method and HEC-HMS. In terms of methodology, this study
establishes a comparative framework to check and assess the performance of the
AHHH Blockage Detection System. Validation is conducted through quantitative
metrics, including recall scores, precision, electrical power consumption (W), data
rate (bps), and alert latency (seconds).
This framework offers a cost-effective and scalable way to evaluate early
warning systems, making it suitable for municipalities with limited resources. This
research presents a method that can be repeated in future efforts to develop early
warning systems for urban areas at risk of flooding. This study will benefit several
key stakeholders:
Local Government Units (LGUs). Early warning systems play a crucial
role in the Philippines to lessen the effects of typhoons and heavy rain. The
systems enable quick responses with SMS alerts and barangay notifications. This
helps communities become more resilient against disasters and ensures the public
is quickly informed, which improves safety and preparedness. Local Government
Units (LGUs), including the Municipal Engineering Office, the Disaster Risk
Reduction and Management Office (DRRMO), and the Barangay Disaster Risk
Reduction and Management Committee (BDRRMC), play a crucial role in leading
disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts at the local level.

========== PAGE 24 ==========
Using the prototype gives local government units (LGUs) important
information about the drainage system. This helps them plan better for city
improvements. Financially, floods cause about ₱50 million in property damage
each year, affecting buildings, roads, and utilities. Research shows that early
warning systems and prompt action can reduce this damage by up to 30% (UNEP,
2025), amounting to around ₱15 million in prevented losses each year. In contrast,
installing a real-time drainage monitoring system would cost about ₱3 million, plus
an additional ₱500,000 annually for maintenance and operations. Their role as first
responders underscores their importance to community safety and swift
emergency response.
General Public / Communities in Flood-Prone Areas. In the Philippines,
early warning systems are vital for mitigating the annual threat of typhoons and
heavy rainfall. These systems facilitate timely evacuations, protect property, and
promote preventive measures to reduce flood damage. For homeowners, alerts
can save ₱10,000 per incident in Metro Manila and ₱3,000-₱5,000 in provincial
cities. In Kabacan, North Cotabato, a single flood inflicted over ₱20 million in
damages (Mag-aso, 2018), highlighting the need for preparedness.
Early warning systems also shield livelihoods, businesses, and local
economies by preventing damage and minimizing downtime. They improve quality
of life by enhancing sanitation and reducing waterborne diseases. The CDC (2025)
reports an increase in leptospirosis cases after floods, likely due to exposure to
contaminated water. However, studies indicate that improving drainage and

reducing contact with floodwaters can cut transmission risk by up to 70% in high-
risk areas. SMS alerts and barangay notifications allow for quicker responses,
boosting community resilience against future disasters.
National Government Agencies. Real-time drainage monitoring helps
national institutions like the DPWH and transportation authorities by improving
disaster resilience, supporting data-driven policy, fostering innovation, and
encouraging knowledge sharing. For transportation, it boosts safety through
proactive planning, better resource allocation (which could improve by 10%), and
fewer disruptions. The system allows real-time tracking of obstructions and
flooding, enabling timely preventive actions (Revised Administrative Code, 1987).
It supports the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010
(RA 10121) and the UN's "Early Warnings for All" initiative (UN, 2022), both of
which promote early warning systems to reduce vulnerability. The findings can
influence national drainage policy, disaster risk reduction guidelines, and the 2030
Agenda/Sendai Framework (UN, 2022). This study also encourages local
innovation and collaboration between governments for disaster management.
Technology Providers and Private Sector Companies. Technology
providers, private companies, and public utilities gain real-time drainage
monitoring. The system sends timely alerts and allows quick responses to
blockages. This helps residents avoid dangers such as waterborne diseases and
property damage. Effective early warning systems can reduce flood-related health
issues by 25% (World Health Organization [WHO], 2019). It builds community
