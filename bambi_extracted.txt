CHAPTER 1
THE PROBLEM AND LITERATURE REVIEW
This chapter establishes the foundation for this study. It begins with an
introduction that provides background information and context, followed by the
theoretical and conceptual frameworks guiding the research. The chapter then
presents the statement of the problem, outlining the specific research questions
and hypotheses. The scope and delimitations clearly define the study's
boundaries, while the limitations address potential constraints. Finally, the
significance of the study emphasizes its contributions to the field, and a
comprehensive definition of terms ensures clarity and consistency throughout the
research.
Background of the Study
Urban flooding is a growing global crisis. It results from rapid urbanization
and climate change, threatening infrastructure and public safety (Rentschler et al.,
2022; Cariaso, 2025). Cities like Jakarta and Mumbai suffer major economic losses
due to poor drainage systems (Asdak et al., 2018; New Media, 2024). In 2023,
floods affected over 50 million people, leading to contaminated water, sanitation
disruptions, and a 20% increase in diarrheal disease cases (Acosta-España et al.,
2024). With an average of 19 to 20 typhoons each year (Espiritu, 2024), the
Philippines faces challenges from clogged drains and slow inspections (Ombay &
Locus, 2024). The severe effects of these conditions were evident during Typhoon

Ondoy, which cost the government around $4.42 billion (GFDRR, 2022).
Moreover, Metro Manila's aging and silted drainage system (Punzalan & Dizon,
2025) is insufficient, according to DPWH Secretary Manuel Bonoan, and suffers
from substandard or nonexistent flood control projects (Sadongdong, 2025;
Superable, 2025). This situation shows a pressing need for community-level early
warning systems and real-time monitoring for drainage management.
The Internet of Things (IoT) has great potential to improve flood and
drainage management. It includes pollution monitoring (Zulkifli et al., 2022) and
open GIS data for urban drainage planning (See et al., 2020). Abedin and Stephen
(2019) developed a GIS-based model that produced flood-extent maps showing
possible locations and severity. Acoustic reflectometry achieved 95% accuracy in
blockage detection (Kelly et al., 2024). Te et al. (2024) used pressure sensors,
LoRaWAN, and solar power, while Rajput et al. (2025) used ultrasonic sensors
and GSM modules. While these studies propose detection methodologies, there is
a distinct lack of published research providing a rigorous, quantitative performance
comparison of such novel detection systems against established benchmarks or
prior art. Therefore, this study will aim to address this critical gap by conducting a
comparative performance evaluation of the proposed Automated Hydro-Hazard
Helper (AHHH) Blockage Detection System against the standardized Rajput et al.
(2025) logic, specifically assessing its practicality, durability, and effectiveness
using verified quantitative metrics.

========== PAGE 7 ==========
To address the shortcomings of current methods and the need for effective
solutions, this study focuses on creating a technology-driven monitoring system for
real-time alerts. The system aims to improve stormwater drainage management,
which is crucial for reducing the economic, environmental, and public health
impacts of flooding, aligning with SDG 13 (Climate Action). This approach also
directly supports the Harmonized National Research and Development Agenda’s
(HNRDA) focus on Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation
(DRR-CCA) by improving monitoring and information sharing (DOST-PCHRD,
2024). It also helps the national goal of protecting infrastructure and building
community resilience (Department of Science and Technology, 2022). By
innovating localized monitoring technologies, the project supports Adamson
University Senior High School's Research Agenda (RA 8) on Multi-Hazard
Assessment Tools and Systems. Additionally, it aligns with the Philippine Disaster
Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 (RA 10121) and the UN's "Early
Warnings for All" initiative (UNFCCC, 2022), both of which highlight the importance
of early warning systems in reducing vulnerability.
Literature Review
Urban Drainage Early Warning System
The development and implementation of effective early warning systems for
urban flooding and drainage management are increasingly recognized as critical
priorities. Recent studies highlight innovative approaches for real-time
6

========== PAGE 8 ==========
environmental monitoring of water infrastructure, which form the foundation of such
systems. For example, Tatiparthi et al. (2025) demonstrated the effectiveness of
UHF-RFID sensors for sewer monitoring, providing a means for early detection of
potential blockages. Complementing this, Pahuriray and Cerna (2025) identified
ultrasonic sensors, rain gauges, and machine learning algorithms as reliable
components for real-time flood detection and prediction, enabling timely warnings
to be issued.
The intensifying societal impacts of urban flooding and rainage blockages
underscore the urgency of advancing early warning systems. These issues pose
risks to public safety and weaken community preparedness. They also bring health
concerns, such as leptospirosis (CDC, 2025; Acosta-España et al., 2024). Cases
from the Philippines reveal the severe destruction caused by typhoon flooding
(GFDRR, 2022; Palawan News, 2023) and the significant economic impact of
unpreparedness (Mag-aso, 2018). The UNEP (2025) stresses the importance of
implementing early warning systems by 2027 to save lives and reduce damage.
Integration of IoT and GIS Spatial Mapping
Recent developments in smart drainage and flood monitoring systems
integrate IoT and GIS to enhance real-time monitoring and response capabilities.
Navia et al. (2024) demonstrated how IoT-enabled sensors can identify storm drain
blockages by continuously measuring water levels and detecting abnormal
patterns. Paudel and Neupane (2021) further explained that IoT architectures with
7

========== PAGE 9 ==========
perception, gateway, cloud, and application layers enable scalable data
transmission and automated alerting.
Other researchers, such as Zulkifli et al. (2022) and Te et al. (2024),
improved the accuracy and reliability of IoT systems by incorporating energy-
efficient sensors, AI-based analysis, and long-range communication protocols like
LoRaWAN. Complementing these efforts, Kashid et al. (2025) utilized ultrasonic
and vibration sensors with cloud-based machine learning to detect blocked
drainage pipes, and Tolentino et al. (2023) developed a community-based flood
tracker capable of sending sensor data for local alerts and notifications. Across
these studies, IoT consistently proves its value in providing real-time monitoring,
fast alerting, and automation, making it a foundational technology for modern flood-
warning systems.
More recent studies emphasize real-time environmental monitoring in
drainage and flood control, often leveraging the combined power of IoT and GIS.
GIS plays a critical role in converting IoT sensor readings into spatially meaningful
information that helps stakeholders understand where flooding or blockages occur.
Abedin and Stephen (2019) used GIS to investigate flood patterns, while See et
al. (2020) advocated participatory mapping. Although these are different, they
exemplify how the incorporation of proper GIS modeling and engagement of
communities could support more flexible and sustainable flood management
preferences. Rajput et al. (2025) developed a simulation-based IoT system to
detect drainage blockages, utilizing the ESP32 microcontroller, HC-SR04
8

========== PAGE 10 ==========
ultrasonic sensor, and SIM900 GSM module to simulate drainage movement. The
model's performance was assessed based on Recall, Precision, Data Rate,
Response Time, and Power Consumption, demonstrating the feasibility of IoT-
based flood detection.
Recall and Precision
In Bramer, Giustini, and Kramer’s (2016) study, they evaluated the recall
and precision of the three leading databases: Embase, MEDLINE, and Google
Scholar, by comparing the databases with respect to their effectiveness for
systematic reviews. The combination of Embase and MEDLINE was found to
achieve the highest recall (81.6%), while still maintaining low precision (≈2%).
Broad searches were thus demonstrated to result in high completeness, but at the
same time, to entail a larger number of irrelevancies.
On the other hand, Sadeli and Lawanda (2023) focused on recall, precision,
and F-measure in an Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) and
found almost perfect recall (1.00) and high precision (0.9713) when the search
syntax was optimized, for example, with the use of quotation marks. Integrating
both studies, recall guarantees that full retrieval and precision give better
relevance; thus, the trade-off between them depends on the system’s objective,
either for thorough academic searches or quick document management. For the
AHHH Blockage Detection System, high recall ensures that all actual blockages
are detected (minimizing false negatives), while high precision ensures that alerts
9

========== PAGE 11 ==========
are only triggered when a blockage is truly present (minimizing false positives),
which is critical for resource-efficient flood response.
Alert Response Time and Data Rate
Alert response time and data rate have been particularly highlighted in the
context of the integration of IoT for early warning and public safety systems. A case
in point is the systematic review of IoT-based early warning systems for floods,
earthquakes, tsunamis, and landslides by Esposito et al. (2022).
Recent studies have taken the latency issue of time-critical IoT systems
even further. According to Leclerc et al. (2025), achieving a high service level
requires minimizing both transmission delays and processing times. At the same
time, Zhang, Zhang, and Sun (2025) worked on a prototype IoT-based public
safety alert system that can deliver alerts in less than 450 milliseconds. Their
findings underscore the fact that the design decisions made regarding protocol,
network type, and edge processing can significantly impact the latency
experienced in realistic emergencies.
Complementing these latency-focused studies, recent work has also
emphasized the importance of data rate in ensuring reliable sensor communication
in environmental monitoring systems. Rahman et al. (2022) evaluated how packet
size, channel-listening intervals, and network setup affect transmission
performance. At the same time, Figueiredo et al. (2019) introduced RiverCore, a
cellular-based IoT device for water-level monitoring.
10

========== PAGE 12 ==========
Their findings revealed that cellular systems enable more frequent and
reliable sensor transmissions. Together, these studies show that data rates are a
key factor in overall system performance. They highlight the need to choose
communication technologies that balance power consumption, coverage, and
reliability, particularly for real-time IoT applications such as detecting drainage
blockages and monitoring floods.
Power Consumption
Energy consumption is an important consideration in Internet of Things (IoT)
applications, especially those that rely on Low-Power Wide Area Networks
(LPWANs). Singh et al.'s (2020) study emphasizes the importance of
understanding energy usage in wireless communication, particularly for battery-
powered end devices such as sensors and actuators. Their empirical analysis of
technologies such as LoRaWAN, DASH7, Sigfox, and NB-IoT indicates that
LoRaWAN and DASH7 are more energy-efficient compared to Sigfox and NB-IoT.
Similarly, García-Martín & Torralba (2023) focus on NB-IoT, presenting an
analytical model for energy consumption in diverse IoT applications. These studies
highlight the importance of selecting the right technology and battery capacity to
optimize the effectiveness and longevity of IoT deployments, while also
acknowledging that real-world applications often experience significant deviations
from ideal-case battery lifetimes. In the AHHH Blockage Detection System,
electrical power consumption must be low to guarantee long-term sustainability
11

========== PAGE 13 ==========
and reduce the frequency of maintenance, particularly in hard-to-access drainage
areas.
Theoretical Framework
The foundation of this study is based on two theories, Modified Manning’s
Equation and Systems Theory. Together, these theories form the hydraulic and
structural foundation for the IoT- and GIS-based AHHH Blockage Detection
System for storm drains.
The Modified Manning's Equation, first proposed by Robert Manning in 1891
and later extended by studies like Wang et al. 2024, is the basis for understanding
flow behavior in open-channel systems, including storm drains. This research will
measure the effects of obstructions on flow movement, hydraulic radius, and water
level, key indicators of blockages.

The hydraulic radius, 'R,' is the cross-sectional area divided by the wetted
perimeter, indicating how efficiently a channel carries water. 'S,' the slope of the
hydraulic grade line, shows the flow's energy gradient, with steeper slopes
meaning higher velocities.
Relationships among discharge (Q), cross-sectional area (A), roughness
coefficient (n), hydraulic radius (R), and slope (S) help determine how changes in
channel traits affect water velocity and height. The AHHH Blockage Detection
12

========== PAGE 14 ==========
System and controlled laboratory simulation are based on this scientific foundation
and utilize ultrasonic sensors to measure and quantify changes in water level that
will operate as a common physical measure of partial or complete blockage in
storm drain systems.
The study is then anchored in the Systems Theory (Ludwig von Bertalanffy,
1968), which establishes the structure and functionality of the proposed system.
Systems Theory has been used in various engineering studies to establish the
design of automated systems that are interconnected and dynamic with self-
regulating capabilities and feedback mechanisms, including autonomous control
systems, smart monitoring technology, and process automation (Fortuna &
Buscarino, 2024). Likewise, the study leverages Systems Theory as it relates to
the interconnectivity and coordination among the sensing, processing, and
communication components of the AHHH Blockage Detection System.
Systems Theory provides a direct line of connection to the dependent
variables or performance metrics by facilitating the effective exchange of data and
information, thereby allowing for the quickest response time built into the system.
In conclusion, Systems Theory supports the engineering basis for the study by
allowing each system subsystem to work in harmony to establish sustainable
operational efficiency and reliability.

Conceptual Framework
The research is built upon a conceptual framework primarily rooted in the
Modified Manning’s Equation. The equation serves as the fundamental basis for
understanding hydraulic principles and informing system design. This equation
guides the selection of sensors, hardware configuration, data requirements, and
testing procedures. Systems Theory provides a strong foundation for organizing
and integrating the various subsystems involved in blockage detection. This theory
facilitates the design and assessment of two key prototype systems: the
experimental AHHH Blockage Detection System and the Standardized Hardware
Benchmark System (SHBS), adapted from Rajput et al. (2025), which serves as a
comparative benchmark.
To enhance system capabilities, the framework integrates Internet of Things
(IoT) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies. IoT enables
continuous, remote monitoring and data collection, while GIS provides spatial
visualization and mapping of blockage occurrences. The AHHH system leverages
both IoT and GIS, while the SHBS primarily relies on IoT with SMS alerts. The
performance of both systems is rigorously evaluated under controlled laboratory
conditions, simulating real-world scenarios. Key performance metrics include recall
score, precision, data rate, electrical power consumption, and alert response time.
Statistical analysis, using descriptive statistics and paired t-tests, will be employed
to determine significant performance differences between the systems.
14

========== PAGE 16 ==========
By anchoring the system design in the well-established Modified Manning's
Equation, the researchers ensure a sound understanding of drainage flow
dynamics. The application of Systems Theory enables a holistic approach to
integrating and optimizing the various components of the blockage detection
system. Furthermore, the incorporation of IoT and GIS technologies provides real-
time monitoring, spatial visualization, and enhanced decision-making capabilities.

time monitoring that contributes to increased urban flooding. To combat this issue,
the study will define the IoT sensors, GIS technology, system designs, and
performance metrics required for blockage detection, and develop and
comparatively evaluate two system designs against conventional methods. By
providing a more effective means of early detection and response, this research
aims to enhance urban resilience and mitigate flood risks.
This study evaluates a blockage detection prototype's performance,
focusing on key indicators: recall score, precision, data rate, electrical power
consumption, and alert response time, assessed via individual t-tests. Detection
efficacy, measured as recall and precision scores, assesses the system's ability to
correctly identify blockages while minimizing both false negatives (recall) and false
positives (precision). Beyond accuracy, electrical power consumption indicates the
system's energy efficiency and reflects its operational sustainability. Data
communication is assessed by the data rate (bits/s), which measures the speed at
which sensor readings are sent to the central unit. Finally, alert response time
(seconds) indicates how quickly blockages trigger notifications, gauging
responsiveness. Statistical significance is evaluated using individual t-tests to
ensure the reliability of the results.
To validate the practical application of the prototype, a true experimental
design will be employed, comparing a fully functional hardware prototype
developed from Rajput's software-based model with the AHHH Blockage Detection
System. The system continuously monitors water levels in storm drains using
