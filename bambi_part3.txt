resilience and social connections. Public utilities experience fewer disruptions,
maintaining continuous service and preventing outages; improved drainage can
cut utility service interruptions by up to 20% (U.S. Department of Energy, 2021).
This increases reliability, customer satisfaction, and resilience against severe
weather. The system also supports better urban planning, which enhances
infrastructure and living conditions.
Challenges include high initial costs, ongoing maintenance, sensor
durability, and data privacy concerns, requiring strong security measures.
However, beyond lowering flood risks, the system offers economic and social
benefits. It can increase property values, reduce business interruptions, and lower
insurance costs, supporting innovation and the local economy.

IoT-and-GIS-based prototype system designed to detect storm drain blockages and
support early warning for potential flooding. In this study, the AHHH Blockage Detection
System served as one of the two systems evaluated.
Blockage Detection. Blockage Detection involves detecting blockages in storm
drains that hinder water movement using sensor data, including water level and flow rate
measurements (Navia et al., 2024). It is the essence of both prototypes' roles: ultrasonic
sensors monitor increases in water levels and the presence of obstacles, providing alerts
and recording data for analysis.
Calibration. Calibration is the process of configuring and verifying a measuring
instrument so that its readings match a known standard, ensuring accuracy (Fluke, n.d.).
In this study, calibration is described based on assuring the sensors and measuring tools
of both prototypes yield precise and consistent readings prior to a performance test,
thereby confirming the legitimacy of the experimental results.
Data Transmission Rate. The data transmission rate between the sensor node
and the server, typically expressed in bits per second (bps), is the metric by which the
efficiency of each system in transmitting sensor data to the central database is compared,
which influences real-time monitoring and alert delivery (Esposito et al., 2022).

transmission of sensor and location data of remote Internet of Things (IoT) nodes to
centralized systems (Awati et al., 2025). In both prototypes, GSM modules are utilized to
transmit blockage notification and sensor information to the central database or
dashboard.
Graphical User Interface. The Graphical User Interface (UI) is a visual part of
software that allows users to interact with the system through graphical objects (buttons,
icons, dashboards, and so on) rather than a text interface (Paganelli et al., 2022). The
AHHH Blockage Detection System uses a web dashboard to monitor real-time sensor data
and alert the user, including a GUI.
Internet of Things. The Internet of Things, or IoT, is a network of connected
devices that use sensors, software, and other technologies to collect and share data to
enable automation and informed decision-making (Paganelli et al., 2022). Both systems
rely on IoT, which enables them to detect, transmit, and generate real-time alerts for
drainage monitoring.
Precision. Precision is a performance metric that measures the proportion of
correctly identified positive results (true positives) among all positive results generated by
a system, indicating its ability to avoid false detections (Ultralytics, n.d.). In this study,
precision is used to assess the accuracy of the system in correctly identifying actual
blockages relative to all detected cases, ensuring minimal false detections and consistent
performance.

CHAPTER 2
PROJECT DETAILS
This chapter details the methodology employed in developing the project. It
outlines the design concept that guided the work, followed by a description of the
overall method and procedures used. The chapter then lists the specific materials,
equipment, and technology used in the project's development. Subsequently, the
project construction phase is detailed, leading into a structured approach for
assessment and testing. Finally, the chapter includes relevant data in tables and
concludes with necessary statements on ethics and AI-use disclosure for complete
transparency.
Design Concept
Building on Rajput et al.'s (2025) Standardized Hardware Benchmark
System (SHBS), the AHHH Blockage Detection System represents a significant
advancement in real-time drainage monitoring, leveraging both IoT and GIS
technologies for early flood warnings. The prototype is an Arduino Uno R4 that
processes data from the A02YYUW ultrasonic sensor. This sensor precisely
measures water levels within drainage basins to identify potential obstructions. The
SIM7600 module, equipped with GPS and GSM antennas, facilitates seamless
wireless data transmission to a centralized database.
The blockage detection system is designed around a threshold-based
monitoring approach using an ultrasonic sensor integrated with an Arduino UNO
32

========== PAGE 34 ==========
R4 microcontroller. Studies recommend multi-level classification instead of a single
alert point to allow stepwise escalation of mitigation measures depending on
severity (Choosumrong et al., 2025). Using percentage-based thresholds (25%,
50%, and 75%) provides a simple, scalable, and easily interpretable way to classify
rising water levels. This approach is commonly used in real-time flood-warning and
IoT alert systems, allowing clear and immediate risk communication without
requiring complex calculations from users (Jadhav et al., 2025). Therefore,
adopting percentage-based thresholds for triggering alerts and classifying risk
levels provides a practical, evidence-based method to represent rising water
conditions in catch basins.
The system continuously reads water levels in the storm drain and
compares each reading against a pre-defined threshold of 4.7 inches or 25% of
the catch basin’s height. Readings below this threshold indicate normal conditions,
prompting the system to continue monitoring, while readings equal to or above 4.7
inches trigger the preparation of an alert message, signaling a potential blockage.
To stabilize the detection behavior, the system also applies a hysteresis margin,
wherein a “clear” condition is recognized only when water level falls to 4.2 inches
or lower. This prevents rapid switching between alert and normal states when
water levels fluctuate near the threshold.
The programmed logic was designed to directly support the system’s
operational flow. The microcontroller retrieves continuous distance readings from
the A02YYUW ultrasonic sensor and converts them into corresponding water
33

========== PAGE 35 ==========
levels. Each reading is evaluated against the 4.7-inch detection threshold. Once
the threshold is met, the system constructs a formatted alert message containing
water-level data and status updates. The alert and subsequent updates are sent
through GSM connectivity to the central server or designated recipients. The
collected data undergoes processing and storage, culminating in a user-friendly,
web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that integrates PostgreSQL and QGIS.
The live readings and alert status are then reflected on the dashboard for real-time
monitoring by users. After transmission, the system returns to continuous
monitoring, ensuring uninterrupted, real-time detection. This interface offers real-
time mapping of water levels and drainage conditions, enabling the identification
of potential problem areas.
Functioning as an early warning system, the platform triggers alerts when it
detects abnormal readings or blockages, facilitating rapid intervention. Unlike the
SHBS, which primarily relies on IoT-based detection and SMS alerts, the AHHH
Blockage Detection System adopts a more proactive monitoring strategy by
merging IoT sensing with GIS-driven visualization and web-based alerts.
By embedding a clear decision point within the Arduino logic, the system
maintains coherence from initial sensor measurement up to final data visualization
and user notification. The threshold logic is embedded exclusively in the AHHH
Blockage prototype (experimental group), which integrates IoT, GSM, and GIS
components. In contrast, Rajput’s Prototype (control group) performs blockage
detection without GIS connectivity.

Methods
This study will employ a systematic methodology encompassing system
design, hardware and software development, integration, testing, data analysis,
and documentation. The research will begin with a comprehensive review of
related literature to inform the design and development of the AHHH Blockage
Detection System prototype. This review focused on key technologies, including
IoT, GPS, GIS, GSM communication, and web-based graphical interfaces.
Existing blockage detection frameworks were analyzed to identify limitations
in detection efficacy, operational efficiency, and responsiveness. Rajput et al.'s
(2025) prototype, serving as the Standardized Hardware Benchmark System
(SHBS), was carefully examined to identify specific areas for improvement.
Through this analysis, the researchers identified key gaps such as limited sensing
reliability during varying water conditions, slower communication performance due
to older GSM technology, and the absence of GIS-based visualization for decision
support.
Based on the literature review and the analysis of the SHBS, specific system
requirements were defined to enhance key performance metrics: recall score,
precision, electrical power consumption, data rate, and alert response time. These
requirements guided the design and fabrication of the AHHH Blockage Detection
System. This involved selecting appropriate hardware components and designing
the model for improved component integration. The assembly of the hardware
36

========== PAGE 38 ==========
included connecting the ultrasonic sensor and the communication module to the
microcontroller using jumper wires and a breadboard.
The Trigger and Echo pins of the ultrasonic sensor were connected to the
corresponding digital pins on the microcontroller, while the communication module
was linked through its TX and RX pins to enable serial data transmission. A single
battery served as the primary power source, supplying the microcontroller and
allowing the attached modules to operate through its regulated output. All
components were arranged on a breadboard to ensure stable and reliable
connections during testing.
Both the SHBS and the improved AHHH Blockage Detection System were
programmed in the Arduino IDE using C++, ensuring compatibility and facilitating
comparative analysis. This involved configuring the Arduino IDE and implementing
C++ code for sensor data processing, communication protocols, and alert-
response algorithms for both systems. Specific configurations were established in
the Arduino IDE to activate and manage the connected components.
Key functions such as pinMode() were used to declare sensor and
communication pins as input or output, while digitalWrite() generated the HIGH
pulse needed to trigger the ultrasonic sensor. The pulseIn() function measured the
echo return time, which was converted into water-level distance. Serial
communication was initialized using Serial.begin(), with Serial.print() and
Serial.println() used to transmit AT commands and output real-time sensor
readings. The millis() function supported non-blocking timing for measurement
37

========== PAGE 39 ==========
intervals, SMS cooldowns, and event tracking. Conditional if statements were
employed to compare computed distances with predefined blockage thresholds,
enabling the system to determine normal and critical water-level conditions.
These Arduino functions collectively allowed the system to generate sensor
signals, retrieve measurements, interpret them, and communicate the results.
Through this coordinated workflow, the device successfully detected abnormal
rises in water level, enabling timely blockage detection as intended.
The thresholds of 25%, 50%, and 75% of the catch basin height are selected
to represent progressive levels of hydraulic risk within the drainage system. These
values allow the prototype to detect and classify rising water levels before they
reach critical capacity. Once the water level reaches any of the defined thresholds,
the prototype sends automated alerts every five minutes as long as the condition
persists.
This periodic notification ensures that emerging hazards remain visible to
users without overwhelming them with continuous messages. When the water
level returns to normal (below the lowest threshold), the system sends a final
“regularization” alert to confirm that the obstruction has been relieved and drainage
has stabilized. After this reset notification, the alert cycle stops until a new
threshold is crossed.
System integration and calibration tests will ensure accurate sensor
readings and stable communication by integrating the power supply, calibrating
sensors, configuring the GSM module for communication, and developing a web-
38

========== PAGE 40 ==========
based interface for real-time data visualization and alert monitoring. To evaluate
the effectiveness of the improved design, experimental validation will be conducted
in a controlled laboratory setup simulating realistic drainage blockage scenarios.
Materials, Equipment, and Technology Used
This study utilized a range of materials, equipment, and technologies to
develop and test two drainage blockage detection prototypes: the Standardized
Hardware Benchmark System (SHBS), based on Rajput et al. (2025), and the
improved AHHH Blockage Detection System.
Featuring an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, the SHBS integrated a SIM900
GSM module, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and a lithium-ion battery.
Programming and sensor calibration were carried out in the Arduino IDE using
C++, chosen for its flexibility and extensive community support. The AHHH
Blockage Detection System was developed as an enhancement of the SHBS. It
utilized an Arduino UNO R4 microcontroller, a SIM7600 GSM module equipped
with both GSM and GPS antennas for improved communication and location
tracking, and an A02YYUW waterproof ultrasonic sensor for more reliable
water‑level sensing.
The researchers opted for the Arduino Uno R4 over its R3 predecessor to
harness its advanced 32-bit architecture and greater processing capabilities. This
decision was driven by the need to efficiently manage the complex data streams
required for GIS integration, with the expectation of significantly reducing Alert
